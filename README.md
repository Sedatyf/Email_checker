# Email Checker

## Requirements

You'll need to make a ``config.env`` file in the ``app`` folder in order to give private information about your account.
In this file you have to create three variables where those variables goes like this :

```env
USERNAME=<your_email_address>
PASSWORD=<your_email_password>
IMAP=<your_imap>
```

In the ``IMAP`` you have to give the right imap service along your mailbox (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.). You can find a list of IMAP here : <https://www.systoolsgroup.com/imap/>
